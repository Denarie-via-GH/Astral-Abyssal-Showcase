  Data: Shipwreck of supposedly supply cargo ship. By analyzing activity log of this
    ship, it seem this spaceship are tasked to deliver food supplies to location
    outside of this local group. They seem to be in hurry, but crash while navigating
    this asteroid field. System suggest this might not be the main cause.
